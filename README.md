### Unfixed Bugs

No unfixed bugs to the best of my knowledge.

## Deployment:


The site was deployed to GitHub pages and the code is:

https://mariahoulihan.github.io/

#### The deployment method is as follows:

I went to my repository for my project, the link is https://github.com/MariaHoulihan/singing-herbalist

I clicked settings in my repository. Next I selected Pages on the menu on the left hand side of the screen, which took me to GitHub pages. I clicked on Source and selected main from the drop down menu. Then I pressed saved. I refreshed the page and my site was live and the link is above in the screen shot and also in the text.  

#### Forking the GitHub Repository

A copy of the original repositiory can be made by forking the GitHub Repository. The copy is made on the an individuals GitHub account, so that an individual (other than the author/creator) can view and make changes if desired without affecting the original repository. 

##### Steps to fork a Github Repository

<ol>
<li>Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository that is required to be forked.</li>
<li>Locate the "Fork" button at the top of the Repository, this can be found just above the "Settings" Button on the menu.</li>
<li>There should now be a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.</li></ol>

##### Making a Local Clone
<ol>
<li>Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and locate the [GitHub](https://github.com/) Repository that is required to be cloned.</li>
<li>Click "Clone or download" underneath the repository name.</li>
<li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, copy the link under "Clone with HTTPS".</li>
<li>Open Git Bash</li>
<li>Next, change the current working directory to the location of where the cloned directory will be made.</li>
<li>Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3 (the link under "Clone with HTTPS").</li>
